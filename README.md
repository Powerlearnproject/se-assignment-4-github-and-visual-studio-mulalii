# SE-Assignment-4
Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
Repositories on GitHub:

github is a version control system based on git its use is too help programmers
collaborate when working on a project.

Github helps collabration by allowing documentation of code and keeping 
record of changes and old versions of programs.

Github also makes sure that code does not conflict with each other.

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
Version Control with Git:

Repositories are work spaces sort of directories that keeps documented code.
A README file is required to hold decumentation information.

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Branching and Merging in GitHub:

Git is the fastes version control system in terms of performance. Git also facilitates
collaboration with features such as merging and bramching.

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

A branch is a seperate workspace that allows collaboration without conflits.
A branch is created with the code git checkout -b new-branch-name. we can merge branches into the main branch with
git merge. 

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
GitHub Actions:

A pull request in Git is a way of asking a maintainer of a Git repository to review and merge code that you have contributed to a project.

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

github Actions is a automation tool that allows us to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.
A simple CI/CD pipeline is if a I as a tester wait for a dev to finish once he is done
I then come in and test the code he has pushed.

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Visual studio is a ide that is created and managed by microsoft. Its key features include
Code refactoring, cloud computing-enabled features, modular installation.

Difference between vscode and visual studio:
vscode is a cross platform editor. visual studio is a simplified version of the full version.

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. How does this integration enhance the development workflow?
Debugging in Visual Studio:

you can integrate github with visual studio by using terminal and git confing.
You can also install git extensions to help. Having git in visual studio will allow
us to work without worrying about breaking the code.

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?
Collaborative Development using GitHub and Visual Studio:

debugging tools available in Visual Studio include breakpoints, winDbg.exe(windows debugger), sos.dll exetension.
Code Analyzer: The IDEâ€™s code analyzer helps you prepare your code for debugging by identifying potential issues

sos.dll can examine the internal state of the common language runtime(CLR).
WinDbg is used to debug languages native or not.

Discuss how GitHub and Visual Studio can be used together to support collaborative development. Provide a real-world example of a project that benefits from this integration.

git 

github and visual studio can be used to support collaboration by having github authentication directly in visual studio

github and visual studio can also make the workflow easier with repo cloning,
creating repos.
